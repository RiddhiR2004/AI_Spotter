# AI Fitness Coach with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

## üéØ Overview

The AI Fitness Coach is a RAG-powered chatbot that provides personalized fitness advice based on:

- **SystemPrompt.md**: 1230 lines of expert calisthenics and weighted training knowledge
- **User's Survey Data**: Personal details, goals, current strength levels, limitations
- **User's Workout Plan**: Generated plan from Gemini API with progress tracking

## ‚ú® Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Signup Survey

Added fields to capture prerequisite strength levels:

- **Pull-ups count**: Critical for determining program phase

These fields are now saved to the `surveys` table in Supabase.

- Loads SystemPrompt.md (1230 lines) as base knowledge
- Retrieves user profile and workout plan from Supabase
- Combines all context for personalized responses
- Maintains conversation history (last 10 messages)

### 3. AI Coach Service (`AICoachService.java`)

**Key Components:**

- **System Prompt Loading**: Reads SystemPrompt.md from assets folder
- **Context Building**: Combines system instructions + user data + conversation history
- **Gemini API Integration**: Sends full context to get intelligent responses
- **Data Formatting**: Structures user data for AI comprehension

## üìã Supabase Schema Updates

### Required Columns in `surveys` Table

Add these columns to capture prerequisite strength data:

```sql
-- Add current strength level fields
ALTER TABLE public.surveys
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS current_pullups integer DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS current_dips integer DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS current_pushups integer DEFAULT 0;

-- Add comments
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.surveys.current_pullups IS 'Number of pull-ups user can currently perform';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.surveys.current_dips IS 'Number of dips user can currently perform';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.surveys.current_pushups IS 'Number of push-ups user can currently perform';
```

### Optional: Chat History Table

If you want to persist chat conversations:

```sql
-- Create chat_history table
CREATE TABLE public.chat_history (
    id bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES public.surveys(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    message text NOT NULL,
    is_ai boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    timestamp bigint NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Add index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_chat_history_user_id ON public.chat_history(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_chat_history_timestamp ON public.chat_history(timestamp DESC);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.chat_history ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Add policy (adjust based on your auth setup)
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous access"
ON public.chat_history
FOR ALL
TO anon
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);
```
